# plan 5035 - planning law (course notes)

# 7 Jan 2015 broad aspects of the law 

## balance between rights and interests

- individuals <-> individuals 
- individuals <-> state

## rule of law 

- the nation is ruled by law, not men

## due process 

- individuals have the right to be heard before authority passes judgement of exercises punishment
- process: different perspectives and accounts/evidence have to be weighed 

- can't pass laws prescribing good behaviour; we can only limit bad behaviour. 

## common law heritage

- British legacy - system of justice and common law
- common law represents King holding court to resolve conflicts (one man stealing a goat from another)
- 400 years old, but new issues and perspectives are always coming up to challenge precedent (e.g. internet)
- Qu√©bec has a different tradition called *civil law*, which sets a code for everything. Court still has room to make decisions, but the code is referred to establish a basic law. 

### stare decisis 

- "bound by a decision": the idea of being guided by precedent, that when a case comes up similar to a past one, that the decisions should be the same. Decision-making should be predictable and guided by past judgements. 
- courts can be bound by previous decisions

## hierarchy of courts

1. supreme court
2. provincial court of appeal 
3. superior courts
4. small claims courts - minor disputes, small $ amounts
5. motor vehicle court
6. tribunals (NSUARB, residential tenancy, human rights board); limited jurisdictions, can only deal with things assigned to them under statute not general common law power

- cases start at the lowest applicable level of court, and move up on appeal. Supreme court only gets involved with matters of national interest, or standard setting. 

## burden of proof 

- rests with the accuser to satisfy the judge that a decision is levelled in your favour
- criminal matters, the burden of proof is always on the crown, and proof must be *beyond a reasonable doubt*
- civil courts have a lower burden of proof (e.g. OJ Simpson trial, Simpson was acquitted from the criminal trial, but found guilty in a civil suit)

## legal profession

- lawyers provide legal opinions based on experience and research. There are rarely definitive or complete answer. There are always elements of chance and the human element. Lawyers also draft documents such as wills, contacts, etc. 

## statutes

- *bills* are proposed laws. Once a bill is approved by the legislature, it becomes a *statute*. 
- There are other legislative documents which are based on statutes. 
- provinces enact planning statutes, which empower local councils to make their own planning documents, such as land-use by-laws. A land-use bylaw has the same legal weight as a statute. 
- we pass laws to solve problems - but sometimes there are simpler solutions. e.g. university wants people to only use certain doors after 6pm. They could enact a law forcing people to only use certain doors at certain times requiring people to be informed, and requiring some enforcement tools. Or they could just lock the doors they don't want people using.

# 14 Jan 2015 notes 

## planning <-> law

- similar in that there are a ridiculous number of things included in the field
- a very large breadth of knowledge is required to look at most issues
- laws are always in flux

## planning burden of proof 

- special burden of proof exists in Nova Scotia for planners 
- council is elected, but the body which rules on individual cases is not elected (NSUARB?) 
- planning policies can be contradictory to each other, appeals can be made where policies are inconsistent with MPS
- appellants can only have decisions overturned *if* policies are inconsistent with MPS
- planners tend to be jack of all trades in smaller jurisdictions which may not have the services of a legal staff

## drafting laws

- "no individual is permitted to deliberately inflict physical harm, mental harm or to otherwise harm another individual"
- *and/or* are completely different words
- *intent/intentionally* have special meaning in criminal law - some crimes require or have special tests for intent (e.g. murder), and others ignore it (e.g. speeding tickets). Serious crimes generally do look at intent. 
- intent vs. criminal negligence
- "intentional touching of another person without that person's consent (physical aspect only)
- intentional - the touching must have been on purpose, as opposed to brushing against someone on the bus
- consent - conceptually very difficult. Verbal permission is only one possibility; body language, or implied consent are allowable in some instances (e.g. sports or play)

## rule of law and free speech

- separation of powers - keeps the courts independent from the legislators. Judges are appointed for life for this reason: their judgements can't be tampered with by changing political parties
- *fourth estate*: the press 
- *charter of rights* - only applies to government actions. Prevents government interference with individual rights. 
- limits to free speech - yelling fire in a packed room is not allowed. We can limit what things go on billboards for example - land use bylaws do restrict certainly kinds of "speech"
- developer on Robie (at Pepperell St.) painted houses badly/ugly as a protest against him not getting a development agreement for condos on the site. He won the case against him. 

## [charter of rights and freedoms](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html)

- parliaments can make whatever laws they like
- Canadian constitution establishes courts etc. and the Charter of Rights is attached. Canadians' rights are protected by the charter both from laws and from practice; rights enshrined in the charter cannot be violated by gov't
- rights are proscribed, not absolute - gov't has to demonstrate a need for a breach 
- Fundamental freedoms 
	2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:
		a. freedom of conscience and religion;
		b. freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;
		c. freedom of peaceful assembly; and
		d. freedom of association.
- everyone is equal before the law
- discrimination has two different approaches:
	1. *legal*: every individual has the right to be treated according to their own attributes
	2. *sociological*: all peoples are equal in ability and background; therefore, everyone should equally share in what is available to society e.g. male/female pay equity) 
- e.g. is it ok to have a retirement village that is restricted to ages 65+? Is there a charter issue? Are people 65+ disadvantaged because of age or physical disability (15.2)?
- problem with distinction between legal and sociological discrimination: e.g. sumo wrestlers must be men: a form of legal discrimination. Women should be considered based on the sociological stance. Restrictive criteria can allow anyone to apply (but allows discrimination to stand)

## Britain

- Britain, unlike Canada, has no constitution though its courts make it difficult to enact laws that violate the community's sense of decency
- Britain is a unitary state, but with some divestment of powers

## Canada 

- Canada is a confederation. Federations divide the country into smaller states. In Canada, not all powers are divested - some are reserved for the federal gov't

## federal powers (91)

- public debt and property
- regulation of trade and commerce
- unemployment insurance
- raising of money by any mode or system of taxation (92.2 provinces are allowed to charge "direct taxes")

- beacons, buoys, lighthouses, and Sable Island
- navigation and shipping (92.10 ships, railways, canals, telegraphs and other connections between provinces or between Canada and other nations are federal matters, but other works within a single province are provincial)

- naturalization and aliens
- marriage and divorce (93.12 solemnization of marriage and divorce is provincial)
- criminal law except the, Constitution of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction but including the procedure in criminal matters (93.14 administration of justice in the province - inc. provincial courts, both civil and criminal, and civil procedure)
- establishment, maintenance and management of penitentiaries (92.6 allows for establishment, maint. and mgmt. of public and reformatory prisons in and for the province)
- classes of subjects as are expressly excepted in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the Provinces (93.16 but generally all matters of a local or private nature are provincial)

## provincial powers (92)

- direct taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes (91.3 raising of money by any mode or system of taxation is federal)
- the borrowing of money on the sole credit of the province 
- the establishment and tenure of provincial offices and the appointment and payment of provincial officers
- management and sale of the public lands belonging to the province and of the timber and wood thereon
- establishment, maintenance and management of public and reformatory prisons in and for the province (91.28 establishment, maintenance and management of penitentiaries is federal)

- municipal institutions in the province
- shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licences in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes
- local works and undertakings other than such as are of the following classes:
	- lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province
	- lines of steamships between the provinces and any British or foreign country
	- such works as, although wholly situate within the province, are before or after their execution declared by the parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces
- the incorporation of companies with provincial objects
- the solemnization of marriage in the province (91.26 marriage and divore are, however, federal)
- property and civil rights in the province
- administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance,and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction and including procedure in civil matters in those courts
- imposition of punishment by fine, penalty or imprisonment for enforcing any law of the province made in relation to any matter coming within any of the classes of subject enumerated in this section
- generally all matters of a merely local of private nature in the province

### natural resources (92A)

- non-renewables, forestry and electrical generation are provincial matters, but export to other provinces cannot discriminate for price or supply
- resources can be taxed (but again, cannot discriminate when exporting to other provinces)

## education (93)

- exclusive realm of provinces
- laws cannot prejudicially affect rights of denominational schools
- reciprocal rights for RC schools in Ontario as well as dissentient schools in Qu√©bec
- any challenge to dissenting schools can be appealed to GG

## planning notes to constitution act

- navigation and shipping - if the port is not national, the province has jurisdiction
- seacoast and fishing - can we make bylaws which deal with the coastal areas?
- first nations and reserves - provinces have no jurisdiction within IRs, so they are unaffected by planning legislation
	- there is e.g. an IR in Dartmouth (Cole Harbour 30), which is unrestricted by Halifax LUB, though it looks like any other suburb in the area based purely on agreement
- residual rights are federal in Canada (by contrast, residual rights are state rights in the USA)
- general spending right - federal gov't can spend money on health if it wants, even though it is a provincial matter. 
- competing rights - interprovincial railways are federal matters, but can they be subject to municipal sign laws or unsightly premises? Courts can provide joint power where there is ambiguity. 
- embassies? - land is treated as if it is the land to which it belongs: French embassy is assumed to be on French land

## human rights act 

- Charter of Rights protects individuals from gov't. Human Rights Act protects individuals from each other. 
- there are both federal and provincial human rights acts. 
- federal HRA applies only in certain areas, like military or in marine hospitals
- provincial HRA applies in most situations

## example MPS

- create an MPS which includes federal lands and IRs. Do we simply ignore those areas? Better to include them in the MPS even though there is no jurisdiction over them. 
- if land changes hands (out of federal or IR hands), with a MPS in place, at least the lands will be covered by planning

# 21 Jan 2015

- review of last week
- 60% of provinces (by pop) needed to amend the constitution
- Constitution lays out institutions necessary for governance
